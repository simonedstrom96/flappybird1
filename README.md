# flappybird1

This game was coded entirely using GPT-4. To run it make sure you have flask installed (pip install flask) and run the app.py script using python in a terminal. You can then access it at the localhost the terminal specifies. This is just a test project for trying out GPT-4 for coding, github, flask and google cloud.
